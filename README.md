# Fuzzy-Match-Patient-Identity-Matching-in-a-Multi-Clinic-Health-System


🎯 Business Scenario:
MediLoop, a fast-scaling HealthTech SaaS platform, serves multiple independent clinics and hospitals. Each provider maintains partial or redundant patient records. As MediLoop centralizes this data into Salesforce Health Cloud (using the Person Account model), deduplication and patient identity resolution become critical.

🧠 Problem:
Patients are often registered with slight differences:

John Smith vs Jon Smyth

Sarah O’Connor vs Sara Connor

Same patient listed with different DOB formats or address abbreviations

These variations are not caught by exact matching, leading to:

Multiple records for the same patient

Fragmented care history

Errors in patient communications, billing, or care coordination

🔍 Fuzzy Matching Solution in Salesforce:
Salesforce tools like:

Einstein Data Detect

Data Cloud Identity Resolution Rules

Mulesoft / External ETL with fuzzy logic (e.g. Levenshtein distance, Jaro-Winkler)

can be configured to:

Match patient records using approximate string similarity

Consider phonetic similarities, typos, and transpositions

Auto-suggest or auto-merge records based on confidence scores

This is especially powerful when combined with unique partial identifiers, such as:

Phone number

Email address

Date of Birth + Zip code

💰 ROI as Data Grows:
Metric	Without Fuzzy Matching	With Fuzzy Matching
Duplicate patient records	10–20%	<1–3%
Average care team coordination delay	2–3 days	<1 hour
Annual support cost due to mismatches	$500K	~$50K
Accuracy of personalized care outreach	70%	>95%
Data steward time spent on manual merge	4 FTEs	0.5–1 FTE

Confidence Score > 90% → Auto-merge
Confidence Score 70–90% → Queue for Data Steward
🚀 Why This Scales Well:
As MediLoop grows to serve:

1M+ patients across 100s of practices

Millions of care plan, claim, and encounter records

Fuzzy matching becomes a critical scalability lever to:

Maintain a single source of truth

Ensure care continuity

Enable ML models that rely on clean data (e.g., readmission risk)
